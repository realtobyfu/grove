- US-001 (2026-02-19): Home discussion starters are now decision-light by enforcing a hard 3-starter cap in both `HomeView` and `ConversationStarterService` (including cached loads), and by always returning one fallback REFLECT starter when context is empty.
- Added regression tests for starter cap and empty-context fallback in `grove/Tests/GroveTests.swift` to keep LLM/heuristic behavior stable.
